For this coursework, i have decided to choose CTN Language Center, as I work there. In this page, there is a landing page, courses, why us, vacancies pages in the navigation bar. However, in the Contact page there is a registration page to register for the first lesson. As this company is quite new, it didn't have a it's website yet. The layouts were inspired by other language centers in Tashkent, as King's Academy and Cambridge LC.
